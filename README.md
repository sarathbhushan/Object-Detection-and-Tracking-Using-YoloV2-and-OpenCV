# Object-Detection-and-Tracking-Using-YoloV2-and-OpenCV

In this project I wanted to count LPG Cylinders going in and out of a gate. For this purpose, I had resorted to the following:
1. Annotation tool to mark the LPG cylinders in images
2. Training Yolo V2 network on these Images
3. Implementing Centroid tracking on the objects identified, using source code from Pyimageserach
4. Finally counting the number of cylinders going up and down of a gate.
